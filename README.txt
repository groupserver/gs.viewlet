Introduction
============

A viewlet manager for GroupServer. For the
most part ``gs.viewlet.manager`` is the same as
``zope.viewlet.manager``. However, it contains some backports and
bug fixes to allow it to work under Zope 2.13 and Zope 2.10.

In ``gs.viewlet.viewlet`` and ``gs.viewlet.contentprovider`` are some
useful base classes for viewlets and content providers on GroupServer
sites.
